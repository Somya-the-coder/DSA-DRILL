/*
Brute Force: Tries all squares, too slow for large cases.
Optimized (Binary Search + Hashing): Uses row/column hashing + binary search, making it efficient.

NOTE:-------------------------------
📝 Rule of Thumb:

If you're finding the largest (maximization problem) → 🔍 Binary Search!
If you're just finding an occurrence → ❌ No need for Binary Search!
