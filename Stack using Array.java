/*Disadvantages of Array Implementation:
It is not dynamic i.e., it doesnâ€™t grow and shrink depending on needs at runtime. [But in case of dynamic sized arrays like vector in C++, list in Python, ArrayList in Java, stacks can grow and shrink with array implementation as well].
The total size of the stack must be defined beforehand.

Definition:-
Stack is a linear data structure that follows LIFO (Last In First Out) Principle, 
the last element inserted is the first to be popped out. It means both insertion and deletion operations 
happen at one end only.
