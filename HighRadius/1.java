Problem 1:
There are N bowls numbered from 1 to N and each bowl can contain maximum 9 marbles. A user has to add a marble to the last bowl i.e. Nth Bowl.
If Nth bowl is full i.e. it already has 9 marbles, you need to check in (N-1)th bowl. If (N-1)th bowl has space to accomodate one more marble, 
then you need to add marble in it and remove all the marbles from Nth bowl. You need to identify the bowl will be modified when you add a marble. 
If all bowls are full, print output as 0.
